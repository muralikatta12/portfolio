        I currently work as a Program Analyst Trainee at Cognizant. My day-to-day involves crafting efficient, scalable solutions, mostly using the Angular and .NET stack. On the side, I enjoy getting hands-on with core languages like C, C++, and Python, along with modern tools like React and JavaScript.

        My goal is always the same: to make sure the final result—the website or application—is not only technically sound but also seamless, beautiful, and a genuinely good experience for anyone who uses it. I approach every project with curiosity and a constant desire to learn.
